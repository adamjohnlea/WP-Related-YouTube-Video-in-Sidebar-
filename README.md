# WP Related YouTube Video in Sidebar

## Tested with WP 5.0+

Add the URL of a YouTube video to your post meta, and that video will display in a sidebar widget when the single post is viewed. 
Good for showing related videos that do not belong as part of the actual post.

Uses the TGM-Plugin-Activation plugin to require the use of Video PopUp plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/video-popup/
