# WP Related YouTube Video in Sidebar
Add the URL of a YouTube video to your post meta, and that video will display in the sidebar when the single post is viewed. Good for showing related videos that do not belong as part of the actual post.

Uses the TGM-Plugin-Activation plugin to require the use of Video PopUp plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/video-popup/
